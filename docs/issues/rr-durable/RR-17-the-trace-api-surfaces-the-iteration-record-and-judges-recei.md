# RR-17: The trace API surfaces the iteration record and judges receive it

## What to build

The evaluation component's trace read projects a fixed field list that drops the researcher's iteration data
entirely — so the richest evidence in the system never reaches the one API built to read traces.

And judges receive only the task's inputs, the final outputs, and the instruction. A judge asked whether work was good is
grading a black box by its last output, which is why the strengths and weaknesses it can write are thin.

Pass the record through, and give judges the campaign's iterations. The verdict stays **one per completion** — judging
every iteration separately would let work that took many attempts outvote work that took few.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The trace API surfaces the iteration record and the campaign's claim/yield/resume evidence
- [ ] Judges receive the iterations of the work they score
- [ ] A judge's feedback names what went wrong in a specific iteration, demonstrated on a multi-iteration campaign
- [ ] Exactly one verdict per completion per judge is still recorded
- [ ] The duplicate-score check is scoped by tag rather than scanning the whole score history

## Spec obligations covered

- `entity-fields.CampaignIteration`
- `entity-optional.CampaignIteration.error`

## Test seams

Seam-5 (judge runtime) primary, Seam-3 (durable evidence: event-store reads) for the trace shape.

## Blocked by

RR-5.

## Handoff plan

**Handoff is crafted AFTER RR-5 lands and is inspected — not before.** This slice consumes that slice's real produced API; a brief written against a guessed signature sends a subagent down a path that does not exist.

Signatures to be read from the landed code rather than assumed:
  - the iteration record's read API and its bounded-excerpt limits
  - the digest field names, which the judge trace-data map will carry

The orchestrator then runs `/propagate` scoped to the obligations above, confirms RED, and seeds the TDD cycle list.

## Disciplines (verbatim — do not summarise, do not skip)

- **Never assume. Chase every bug to its ROOT CAUSE.** No band-aids, no "probably," no jumping to conclusions.
  Reproduce -> minimize -> fix the actual cause. Don't blame the network or the model — the cause is in the code or
  the setup. And rule out the *harness itself* (a stuck flag, a stale fixture, a tool that stores results oddly can
  fake a symptom): distinguish "the work is wrong" from "my measurement is wrong."
- **TDD for real logic: red -> green -> refactor, one test at a time.** Vertical tracer-bullet slices, never
  horizontal (don't write all tests then all code). Test **behavior through public interfaces**, so tests survive
  refactors.
- **Injected-capability seam pattern.** Keep logic pure and testable; inject effects (clock, RNG, network, storage)
  as capabilities that **default to the real impl and are faked in tests**.
- **Durable tests AND live QA.** A passing unit test is necessary, not sufficient — also drive the real thing. Then
  turn what you verified into a durable test so it's guarded on every run.
- **Dispatch sub-work to fresh agents, then INDEPENDENTLY and ADVERSARIALLY verify it.** Never trust a subagent's
  "done / all green" report — re-run the proof, re-read the code, try to break the claims, demand proof.
- **Report faithfully** — including your own mis-steps and anything you couldn't verify.

Standing rules for this arc:

- **Never weaken a generated test to make it pass.** A `/propagate`-generated test is contract. If it is wrong, the
  spec is wrong: report it, the orchestrator `/tend`s and re-propagates.
- **A generated test green before you implement is a finding**, not success — already-covered or vacuous. Report it.
- **Default-path behaviour must not change** until RR-15 flips the default. Every slice before it keeps the
  non-checkpointed path byte-identical.

## Do NOT touch

- `specs/*.allium` — report divergences with a proposed classification (spec bug / code bug / aspirational design /
  intentional gap); never edit. The orchestrator is the only spec writer.
- Any slice not named in this brief. If you find a defect outside your slice, report it; do not widen the diff.
- `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, the grill log — read-only inputs.
- Other worktrees under `~/Desktop/Code/orc*` — other work is live in them.

## Report back

- The `/propagate` coverage line verbatim: `N obligations, M covered, K uncovered`, with a reason for every
  uncovered one (infrastructure gap / unmappable / out of slice). No silent caps.
- Any propagate-emitted mock, stub or TODO skeleton, declared explicitly as a tracked gap.
- Proposed divergence classifications for anything where spec and code disagree.
- What you could NOT verify, stated plainly.

## Orchestrator gates (run after you report)

`/inspect-orc` against this slice: re-run the proof independently, re-read the code, try to break the claims, plus the
three ORC-specific gates — spec-conformance (`allium check` / `analyse` error-free by **severity count** on touched
specs), `/weed` check-mode with classified divergences, and the obligation audit (the coverage line above must survive
into the slice report). Allium's internal verify is the CLAIM; `/inspect-orc` is the falsification.
